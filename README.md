## Hi there, My name is Matheus
### I'm studying to become a software developer
I'm a open source software enthusiastic I only use Linux as a desktop and I try automatize everything. I have a few IoT projects with ESP32 and Arduino.

## Skills: C/C++ / Python / JS / HTML / CSS / 

- I’m writing a book {Complete and Free Introduction to Mathematics}.
- I’m currently working on my first version of Mot Maitrise, a program for increasing vocabulary and language expertise that gets sentences through the internet and turns them into flashcards with spaced repetition to memorize and masterize the structure and the pronunciation, since I'm choosing an audio engine to help with the pronunciation, very useful for language learning pourpose.
